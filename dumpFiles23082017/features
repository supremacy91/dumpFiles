Magento Encryption

Encryption is done via the Mage_Core_Model_Encryption class.
Hashing runs via the method hash which uses MD5. Not sure why did didn't go with SHA but it should be sufficient.
Encrypting data for later use is done using the encrypt method that use the Varien_Crypt class that by default relies on Mcrypt to do it's job.
Since it uses a factory pattern you can easily use other encryption methods as well in theory by adding a class file in the app/code/local/Varien/Crypt directory.
The Varien_Crypt_Mcrypt class is a wrapper for PHP Mcrypt used to encrypt data with the key given in the local.xml file under node path global/crypt/key. If you want to add your own encryption class you can probably use that class best as an example
